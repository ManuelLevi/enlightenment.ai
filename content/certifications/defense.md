Portugal's Ministry of Defense has granted Enlightenment.AI exclusive licensing for military goods and technology commerce - authorization reserved for organizations meeting the highest standards of technical capability and national security clearance.

### Portugal's Ministry of Defense has granted Enlightenment.AI exclusive licensing for military goods and technology commerce - authorization reserved for organizations meeting the highest standards of technical capability and national security clearance.

Following comprehensive evaluation, Enlightenment.AI has been formally licensed to develop and deploy AI systems for defense applications. This authorization places us among a select group of technology companies trusted with military-grade artificial intelligence development.

"When national security depends on AI reliability, governments don't take chances. Defense contractors know that in mission-critical applications, AI systems must perform flawlessly - there is no margin for error. Our systems are built to operate offline, maintain functionality under attack, and continue operating even when components are compromised."
â€” Manuel Levi, Founder, Enlightenment.AI

The Ministry of Defense licensing process requires demonstrating both advanced technical capabilities and meeting strict security clearances. Our authorization confirms our readiness to deliver resilient AI systems engineered for hostile environments - where connectivity is unreliable, infrastructure is vulnerable, and system failure could mean mission failure.
This brings our total government certifications to four - spanning enterprise ICT excellence, IoT leadership, health innovation, and now defense technology authorization.
