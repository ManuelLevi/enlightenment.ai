# Objective

The primary objective is to **create wealth** in the most healthy, easiest and low-variability kind of way.

I want to be able to buy my father a Ferrari in the next year, and my mother a house with a nice garden.

This is how this happens:
* I constantly show my work to **the right people**.
* I completely avoid **the wrong people**.
* I create **so many leads** for high-paying, low-effort jobs, that I have enough money for myself and to hire others without ever having to worry about cashflow.
* My clients work on a retainer, they pay me monthly, creating a **healthy cashflow**. I **avoid project-work completely**
* I create **videos, books and other content** that create so much authority that my sales process requires absolutely no proposals, no sales calls, no pitching. People hire me directly on Calendly, Upwork, or Stripe.
* People **know** I delegate, and they will still hire me, or my team.
# Content

## Content types

| Content type | Description | Note |
|:------------:|:-----------:|:----:|
| Portfolio | Shows my work experience and builds authority (Must have) | Highest priority |
| Blog | Good to show ongoing work, not so much information as that kind of content is being replaced with ChatGPT conversations. | Important to show activity and to force "documenting the journey" |
| Tools | People visit the website to use the tools. | Can yield great results, but requires some effort to setup |
| Video | People are searching for things more and more on Youtube. Youtube = search with intention, Instagram = randomly finding things. | Might take a while to do. I was never able to finish a complete video |

# Target Audicence

## Company type

- Startups with Money (Highest Target)

- Denmark ($3,200/month union agreements min wage)

- Singapore (undefined minimum wage)

### Location block

We need to avoid markets where income asymmetry creates social friction.  
It’s possible to get very well paid even in lower-income countries—for example, I once earned 1.6k EUR per day in Portugal.

But this came with serious downsides:  
* **Social resentment**: Many saw it as unfair, assuming we couldn’t possibly be worth that much more than them.  
* **Status threat**: Some became openly envious and even tried to sabotage the project.  
* **ROI pressure**: High daily rates in low-income contexts trigger urgency—clients want fast, dramatic results.  
* **Perceived overspend**: Even when budget exists, premium work is seen as a short-term cost spike, not a long-term investment.
* **Legal risk**: Premium rates mixed with resentment and envy often escalate into legal action—false claims, disputes, or contract challenges. We’ve been sued twice, one of them by the company that paid us 1.6k EUR per day. We were right. We won, but it cost time and resources.

So while high-paying roles exist in poorer countries, they often come with invisible costs—fragile trust, hostile collaborators, and a constant need to justify your value. That makes success unsustainable.


#### Required Action

High risk and limited resources make aggressive filtering non-negotiable. Blocking traffic from poor countries is a mandatory part of our risk management and success strategy.



## Skip the sales part

The content and sales funnels are so well built, contracts come without pitching, or even a sales call, or proposal.

## No project-work

Everything is retainer or hourly based. No projects are allowed. We don't do estimates either.

## Retain Attention

When high-value visitors land on the site, we want to make sure they’re pulled into a system that brings them back organically—without ads, pitches, or reminders.

These are the current channels to enable that:

* **LinkedIn** – They can follow the company or personal page. Critical to reseed our LinkedIn presence with high-value, international contacts only.
* **YouTube** – Subscriptions ensure they see our content again. Video builds trust, removes the need for sales calls, and accelerates authority.
* **Email** – If they download something or engage with a tool, we collect the email. We follow up only with value-driven content (not sales).

This entire section exists to ensure that anyone who sees us once is likely to see us again—until hiring becomes inevitable.

## Ads

Eventually, we will deploy an advertizing campain. For this, it's important that we collect prospect emails.


## The Sales Process

No work is free. 

Every step is billable. Discovery, quoting, and planning are services, not freebies.

It's not sales call - it's a paid discovery call.

It’s not a proposal – it’s a paid strategy document.

No free quotes. No free calls.
